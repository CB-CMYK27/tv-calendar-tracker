# TV Calendar Tracker

**Live app:** https://cb-cmyk27.github.io/tv-calendar-tracker/

## The Problem

Streaming platforms have stopped releasing shows as complete box sets. Instead, they're drip-feeding episodes weekly, and I kept forgetting when and where my favourite shows were airing. I'd miss episodes, forget which platform they were on, and have no idea when new shows I was excited about were actually launching.

I needed a simple way to track future episodes, know which streaming service they're on, and get reminded at a time that actually works for me (not at 1am when they technically drop).

## The Solution

This wee programme lets you:
- Search for any TV show
- See **future episodes only** with air dates and streaming platform
- Read episode synopses where available
- Select which episodes you actually want to watch
- Download them as calendar events at **your preferred time** (because who wants a reminder at 1am?)
- Export as .ics format that works with any calendar app (Apple, Google, Outlook, whatever)
- Track when new shows launch in the future so you don't forget they're coming

## How to Use

1. Search for your favourite TV show
2. Browse upcoming episodes with air dates and descriptions
3. Tick the ones you want to watch
4. Set your preferred viewing time (defaults to 7pm)
5. Download the calendar file
6. Import into your calendar app
7. Never miss an episode again

## Technical Details

- Single HTML file, runs entirely in your browser
- Uses the [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com) for show data
- Generates .ics calendar files compatible with all major calendar apps
- No server required, no data collected
